## UNDERSTANDING PROGRAMMING CHAPTER 1
1. What is a Computer?
- A computer is an electronic device which accepts data, processes it, stores it and gives us information.

2. What is Computer made up of? and explain ...
- A Computer comprises of hardware and software components. Hardware components are the physical and visible 
components of the computer, the elements we can feel while Software are specific instructions or programs written 
that works within the computer, guiding its operation by controlling the hardware to perform specific tasks.

3. List five major hardware components.
- Central Processing Unit (C.P.U).
- The Memory.
- Storage Devices.
- Input and Output Devices.
- Communication Devices.

4. The CPU speed is measured in hertz.

5. What is bit? What is byte?
- Computer is nothing more than a series of switches, when the switch is in the off state the value is zero(0)
and when it is in the on state the value is one (1). Storing data has to do with manipulating the switches and 
these values (0 and 1) has been translated to be in the binary system, these values are known as **BIT**.
**BYTE** - a byte comprises of 8 bits. Programs and the data used during programs execution are stored in bytes.

6.  What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
- Memory is a container or a housing that stores bytes that are containing written programs and their data in an orderly sequence.
It is a playground for the execution of programs, the CPU retrieves and execute intructions from the programs stored in memory.
RAM stands for *Random Access Memory*. These bytes that are stored has unique location/address use for retrieval and execution and 
they can be accessed ***randomly*** due to this fact, the memory is known as RAM.

7. Memory is measured in bytes.

8.  What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
the diff is simply, memory holds data as long as the computer or system is on, while storage device holds data not withstanding power.
that is to say it holds data permanently.

9. What language does the CPU understand?
- The CPU understands machine language which is the primitive language.

10. What is an assembly language?
- An assembly language is the language that was introduced to ease the writing of programs or instructions using the machine language,
since writing in ML(machine language) was tedious, it incorporates the use *mnemonic* which are short descriptive words that denotes 
instructions to be carried out. It is a low-level programming language.

11. What is an assembler?
- An Assembler is a program that translates assembly language into machine code which can be understood and executed by the computer.

12. What is a high-level programming language?
- High-level programming language are languages that are English-like, easy to read, understand and easy to use. They are not machine dependent.

13. What is a source program?
- Any program or instruction written in high-level programming language is known as a source code or a source program.

14. What is an interpreter?
- An interpreter is a tool which translates source programs or code, one statement at a time for execution by the CPU.

15. What is a compiler?
- A compiler is a tool which translates source programs or code, by compiling the instructions, all of it first, before sending or 
feeding it to the CPU for execution.

16. What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?
- An interpreted language is a language that uses interpreter as its tool for translation while a compiled language uses a compiler as
it's own translator.
